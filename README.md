# What is this?
This is a database of Radio Station logos as well as Logos I have either Custom-Built or modified to suit my own usage.

These files are intended for usage within IPTV & radio clients.

The logos of some Radio Stations have been slightly altered to fit a preferred resolution to make it display correctly in my Radio client.

# Example Usage
I use these files within ErsatzTV & DizqueTV and to create my own channels and listen to radio within Plex but when accessing the server remotely, the Plex Desktop App doesn't load many of the icons as it is expecting them to be on a local IP which it cannot access as I am not at home, thus this github database is my solution.

# Copyright & Fair Use
Most of the TV Channel logos were put together by me and you should feel free to download and utilise them.
When it comes to the Radio Stations, those logos belong to their respective owners and will be removed if they request it.
